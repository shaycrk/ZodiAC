    <h2>A new approach to coursemarker gimmick rallyes</h2>

    We're trying something new for this rallye: instead of looking for physical coursemarkers hung up on poles along the route, you'll use your phone to find them based on your GPS location. Coursemarkers are detected via a website in your phone's browser -- so there's no app to download -- and the site will let you know when you're approaching one.

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your smartphone</li>
        <li>A car charger (to make sure you don't run out of battery mid-route)</li>
        <li>A navigator (or at minimum a hands-free mount for your phone)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="using_the_cm_finder.pdf">Find more details and instructions on how to get set up in this PDF</a></p>

    <h2>In the Mountain View area and want to test it out ahead of time?</h2>

    <a href="test_route.pdf">Check out this brief test route</a> starting at Cuesta Park with locations of a few GPS Coursemarkers -- it should only take a few minutes to drive and we'd appreciate hearing how it went!
