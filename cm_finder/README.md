# CM Finder
Simple javascript app for virtual coursemarkers that uses geolocation and a set of coursemarker locations to alert the user and show the coursemarker label.

Currently hosted separately from the virtual rallye site, via S3 at: https://zodiac-cm-finder.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

Note that the geolocation feature may require HTTPS hosting (which S3 provides) on some browsers.
